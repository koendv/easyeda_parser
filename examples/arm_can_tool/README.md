Output of _easyeda\_parser_:

- console output: [output.txt](output.txt)
- yaml file for AI upload: [pcb_analysis.yaml](pcb_analysis.yaml)

Sample queries for AI:

- Is the file pcb_analysis.yaml truncated?
- Assess.
- The 74HC14 is used to debounce the switches.
- The CANBUS transceiver has a common mode choke L1.
- The USB is USB2.0 HS.
- D7 is ESD protection for the USB.
- Are there unknown components?
- Assume canbus transceiver creepage is 9mm, clearance is 8mm.
- Flash U7 is used as "Execute in Place" program storage.
- FPC1 is the connector for OLED1.
- Firmware of this device is at https://github.com/koendv/arm_can_tool . Assume the README is authoritative in what it states, but do not infer anything it does not state.
